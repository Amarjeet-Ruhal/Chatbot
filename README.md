# 🤖 Chatbot using NLP and Deep Learning

## 📘 Overview
This project showcases a chatbot developed as part of **Personify's comprehensive NLP and Machine Learning training program**. The notebook demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning-based conversational AI using real-world datasets and modern NLP techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build an intelligent chatbot capable of understanding and responding to natural language queries.
- Apply key NLP preprocessing steps and deep learning frameworks to train a robust model.
- Evaluate the chatbot's performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tune for improved responses.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Keras** – for building and training the neural network.
- **TensorFlow** – backend for deep learning computations.
- **NumPy** – for efficient numerical operations and data manipulation.

## 📚 Key Features
- Data Preprocessing:
  - Tokenization
  - Lemmatization
  - Normalization
- Model Architecture:
  - Deep neural network using Keras and TensorFlow
  - Trained using custom chatbot dataset provided by Personify
- Model Evaluation:
  - Training and validation metrics plotted
  - Accuracy and loss analysis

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Untitled-1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all code and explanations for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- intents.json: Proprietary dataset provided by Personify during the program.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- The chatbot shows promising accuracy in understanding user inputs and generating relevant responses.
- Effective use of preprocessing and normalization enhanced the model's performance.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
